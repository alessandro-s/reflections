Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would want to use a remote repository in the following circumstances:
  * I want to keep a backup copy of a file stored in a cloud rather than on one device
  * I want to access the same file from multiple devices
  * I want to collaborate on the same file with other people
